<h2 align="center">Let's classify some cute puffins</h2>
Puffins refer to three species of small alcids in the bird genus Fratercula. For eight months of the year, puffins live on the ocean. These pint-sized birds are well adapted for sea life and enjoy devouring fish. When the warmer spring weather arrives, they head to land for breeding â€“ usually around May to August. Unfortunately for puffins their good looks fade away at some point each year. One of their most distinct features, the brightly coloured parrot-like beak, loses its technicolour in winter. But when breeding season starts on land, their vibrant appearance returns in time for them to attract a mate.
